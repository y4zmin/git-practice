            Hello! I'm YazmÃ­n (yaz-meen)
            <br></br>
            I am currently attending Arizona State University in
            Tempe, Arizona, where I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in 
            Software Engineering. This coming fall, it will be my fourth and final year at ASU. I am originally from Phoenix, and I am proud to come from a vibrant Latino community and 
            family of immigrants hence the monarch butterfly theme! Monarch butterflies are known to 
            migrate between North and central America depending on the season for survival, which deeply resonates with me. 

            <br></br>
            When I am not staying up late working on assignments for class, I like to to read and 
            volunteer in my community! My college town hosts an annual arts festival that I always like to help out in to support local artists. 
            I am also a fashion-lover, I have been absolutely binging Project Runway this summer.

            <br></br>
            And I enjoy alternative rock music and kpop ðŸŽµ

        <div class="coding-parent">
            <p id="coding-text">
                My coding journey began with Kode with Klossy back when I was in high-school. I took the Web Development track in summer 2021, 
                and it helped me find direction in what I wanted to study and build a career out of: technology.

                <br><br>
                Since then, I have taken numerous programming classes in college as well
                as classes on theory etc. that covered more of the abstract problem-solving 
                thinking that is involved in Computer Science.
