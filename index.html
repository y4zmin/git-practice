        <p id="about-me-name">Hello! I'm Yazm√≠n (yaz-meen)</p>
        <p id="about-me-info">I am currently attending Arizona State University in
            Tempe, Arizona, where I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in 
            Software Engineering. This coming fall, it will be my fourth and final year at ASU. I am originally from Phoenix, and I am proud to come from a vibrant Latino community and 
            family of immigrants hence the monarch butterfly theme! Monarch butterflies are known to 
            migrate between North and central America depending on the season for survival, which deeply resonates with me. 

            <br></br>
            When I am not staying up late working on assignments for class, I like to to read and 
            volunteer in my community! My college town hosts an annual arts festival that I always like to help out in to support local artists. 
            I am also a museum-lover and enjoy falling into wikipedia rabbit holes about any topic.
