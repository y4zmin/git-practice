        <p id="about-me-name">Hello! I'm YazmÃ­n (yaz-meen)</p>
        <p id="about-me-info">I am currently attending Arizona State University in
            Tempe, Arizona, where I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in 
            Software Engineering. This coming fall, it will be my fourth and final year at ASU. I am originally from Phoenix, and I am proud to come from a vibrant community and 
            family of immigrants hence the monarch butterfly theme! Monarch butterflies are known to 
            migrate between North and central America depending on the season for survival, which deeply resonates with me.
